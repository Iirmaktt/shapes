# Architecture Updates - Following Assignment Requirements

## Changes Made to Follow Specifications Exactly

### Backend Changes (Spring Boot)

#### 1. Simplified REST API
- **REMOVED**: `/api/shapes` endpoint (data now only via WebSocket)
- **REMOVED**: `/api/panel` endpoint (panel info now only via WebSocket)
- **KEPT**: Only `/api/setShapes` endpoint as specified in requirements

#### 2. WebSocket Connection Flow
- **Panel Info on Connection**: Server sends panel size (1000x800) as first message when WebSocket connects
- **Message Types**: 
  - `{messageType: "panel", width: 1000, height: 800}` - sent on connection
  - `{messageType: "shapes", shapes: [...]}` - sent every 30ms with shape data

#### 3. Shape Broadcasting
- **Frequency**: 30ms intervals (~33 FPS) as specified
- **Content**: All shape data in every message (not just changes)
- **Movement**: 25% of shapes move at any time, changes every 3 seconds

### Frontend Changes (React)

#### 1. Proper Loading State Management
- **Added**: `isInitialized` state to track when panel info is received
- **Loading Flow**: 
  1. Shows "Loading panel info..." until WebSocket connects AND panel info received
  2. Shows "Loading controls..." for controls until initialized
  3. Only renders canvas when both connection and panel info are available

#### 2. WebSocket Message Handling
- **Panel Info**: Waits for initial panel message before showing canvas
- **Shape Data**: Processes shape updates continuously after initialization
- **Connection Management**: Proper reconnection with exponential backoff

#### 3. Simplified UI
- **Removed**: All complex styling, gradients, animations
- **Minimal**: Basic HTML elements with simple borders
- **Focus**: Core functionality without visual distractions

### Key Architecture Principles Followed

1. **Single API Endpoint**: Only `/setShapes` for configuration via REST
2. **WebSocket-First**: Panel info and all shape data via WebSocket only
3. **Connection-Based Initialization**: Panel size sent immediately on WebSocket connect
4. **Complete Data Broadcasting**: Every WebSocket message contains full shape state
5. **Proper Loading States**: Client waits for essential data before rendering
6. **Performance Optimizations**: React.memo, direct DOM manipulation, memoized rendering

### Message Flow

```
1. Client connects to WebSocket
2. Server immediately sends: {messageType: "panel", width: 1000, height: 800}
3. Client receives panel info → sets isInitialized = true → shows UI
4. Server broadcasts shape data every 30ms: {messageType: "shapes", shapes: [...]}
5. Browser calls /setShapes?circles=X&rects=Y&triangles=Z → new shapes created
6. Updated shapes immediately broadcast via WebSocket to all clients
```

### Compliance with Requirements

✅ **Panel size sent on WebSocket connection establishment**  
✅ **Only one REST API endpoint (/setShapes)**  
✅ **All shape data via WebSocket broadcasting**  
✅ **Client waits for panel info before rendering**  
✅ **30ms broadcast intervals (~33 FPS)**  
✅ **25% shapes moving at any time**  
✅ **Complete shape data in every WebSocket message**  
✅ **Multi-client support with shared broadcasts**  
✅ **Performance optimizations (React.memo, direct DOM)**  

This architecture now perfectly matches the assignment specifications.
